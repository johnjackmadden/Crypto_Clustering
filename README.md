# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Crypto Currency
## Objective
###  The purpose of this exercise was to use unsupervised machine learning to interpret a data set of various cryptocurrencies trading on the market to see what clusters would make sense to offer as a packaged investement for potential clients. Unsupervised machine learning was used since there is not a known output for what the various data clusters might look like using K-Means. The scikit-learn and hvplot libraries were used for this excercise
## Results
### Principal Component Analysus was used to speed up the efficency of the machine learning algorithyms in order to reduce the number of imput features to a more manageable size to reduce overfitting.
## Summary
