# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Crypto Currency
## Objective
###  The purpose of this exercise was to use unsupervised machine learning to interpret a data set of various cryptocurrencies trading on the market to see what clusters would make sense to offer as a packaged investement for potential clients. Unsupervised machine learning was used since there is not a known output for what the various data clusters might look like using K-Means. Principal Component Analysus was used to speed up the efficency of the machine learning algorithyms in order to reduce the number of imput features to a more manageable size to reduce overfitting. The scikit-learn and hvplot libraries were used for this excercise.
## Results
###
## Summary
### After the K-Means analysis, the optimal amount of clusters for this data set seem to be 4 by looking at the elbow graph above in the results section. However, there is an outlier of one cluster with exactly 1 coin: BitTorrent. This warrents further investigation to see why the BitTorrent coin is so unique in the world of crypto and what seperates it from more popular and well-known cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
